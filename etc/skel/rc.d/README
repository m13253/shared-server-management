Here is the per-user configuration directory.
Files ending with .start will be executed during boot;
files ending with .stop will be executed during shutdown;
files ending with .conf or .service will be executed during both boot and
shutdown with an argument of either 'start' or 'stop'.

Scripts of every user will be executed one after one in alphabetical order;
scripts of different users will be executed parallelly.
All scripts are executed with bash.
